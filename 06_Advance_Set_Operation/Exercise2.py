# Coding exercise --> List, Tuples and Set
# Create a list, called my_list, with three numbers. The total of the numbers added together should be 100.
my_list = {20,30,50}


# Create a tuple, called my_tuple, with a single value in it
my_tuple = ('Hello',)
print(type(my_tuple))
# Modify set2 so that set1.intersection(set2) returns {5, 77, 9, 12}
set1 = {2,5,77,9,12,34}
set2 = {32,5,9,77,12,20}

print(set1.intersection(set2))
